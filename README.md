# stock_market_prediction-using-lstm
This is a project on prediction of the stock price based on past data, in this project i used lstm neural network which is having short term memory which can store and edit a memory along with the whole neural network training. So in this project we select a feature like high column or any other column and made a dataset in which each row contains past 60 entries as x label and next entry as y label, so the lstm will train upto that data and tries to understand the trend of that data, so finally if we give our past data information it will predict the future stock price.
